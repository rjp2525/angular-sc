# angular-sc
A sample Electron app built with Angular that plays SoundCloud stuff

## Getting Started
First you will need to run `npm i` to install the dependencies. Next, you run `npm start` to run it! (This should all work unless I messed something up.)

Note that you might need to run `npm start`, then stop it, then start it again the first time, because Electron will be looking for the `./dist` folder even though it might not be ready yet!
